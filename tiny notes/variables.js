// DEFINING VARIABLES
// the most common one is let
let luckyNumber = 13;
// here u set a number which is 1 of 7 primitive data types
// (string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, null)

// u dont actually need to define it rn
let luckyNumber;
console.log(luckyNumber);
// automatically set to undefined

// or u can explicitly represent an empty value with null
luckyNumber = null;

// u can also set it to a string which is an entirely diff data type
luckyNumber = 'thirteen';

// any data type that isnt primitive will automatically inherit from the object class
luckyNumber = new Object();

// let isnt the only way to assign things!
const name = 'emmanuel';
// used for variables that cannot be assigned later!

// most common way to define variables
var badIdea = 'avoid var if unless you are smart'; */
